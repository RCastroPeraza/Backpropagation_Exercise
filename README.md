* 🔄 Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in training neural networks. It helps in minimizing the error by adjusting the weights through gradient descent. Here's how it works:

- Forward Pass: Compute the output of the neural network.
- Calculate Error: Determine the difference between the predicted and actual values.
- Backward Pass: Propagate the error back through the network, adjusting the weights to reduce the error.

🟦 Hessian Matrix
The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. It's crucial in understanding the curvature of the function and optimizing algorithms.

## 🟧 Jacobian Matrix
The Jacobian matrix represents all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. It is essential in transforming coordinates and in understanding how functions change.

## 🌐 Multivariable Calculus
Multivariable calculus involves calculus with functions of multiple variables. It is the foundation for understanding gradients, divergence, curl, and more in higher dimensions.
### Gradients
The gradient of a function \( f \) is a vector of its partial derivatives:
