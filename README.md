🔄 Backpropagation
Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in training neural networks. It helps in minimizing the error by adjusting the weights through gradient descent. Here's how it works:

Forward Pass: Compute the output of the neural network.
Calculate Error: Determine the difference between the predicted and actual values.
Backward Pass: Propagate the error back through the network, adjusting the weights to reduce the error.

🟦 Hessian Matrix
The Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function. It's crucial in understanding the curvature of the function and optimizing algorithms.

\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 \partial x_n} \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 \partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n \partial x_1} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n \partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n^2}
\end{bmatrix} \]
## 🟧 Jacobian Matrix
The Jacobian matrix represents all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. It is essential in transforming coordinates and in understanding how functions change.
\[ J(f) = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix} \]
## 🌐 Multivariable Calculus
Multivariable calculus involves calculus with functions of multiple variables. It is the foundation for understanding gradients, divergence, curl, and more in higher dimensions.
### Gradients
The gradient of a function \( f \) is a vector of its partial derivatives:
\[ \nabla f = \left[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_2}, \cdots, \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n} \right] \]
### Divergence
The divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) is a scalar measure of its "outflowing-ness":
\[ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_1} + \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial F_n}{\partial x_n} \]
### Curl
The curl of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) measures the rotation at a point:
\[ \nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \left( \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x_2} - \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_3}, \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_3} - \frac{\partial F_3}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial F_2}{\partial x_1} - \frac{\partial F_1}{\partial x_2} \right) \]
